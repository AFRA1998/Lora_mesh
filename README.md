This project is a test implementation of the LoRaMesher library under the ESP-IDF framework. The original version of the library is designed for use with PlatformIO and Arduino IDE.

In this project, I have made the necessary modifications to adapt the library for compatibility with ESP-IDF, enabling its functionality within this framework. The goal is to test the libraryâ€™s features and ensure it can be executed seamlessly on ESP32 devices using ESP-IDF.

This project serves as a foundational step for further development and exploration of LoRa mesh networks using the LoRaMesher library. It also highlights the process of adapting existing libraries to new platforms while maintaining their core functionalities.
